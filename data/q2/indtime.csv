The official statement released by the company claims that only a limited number of Care2 member accounts were accessed by the cybercriminals, but as a precaution measure, all their 17,911,623 account holders are forced to change their passwords on their next log-in.  We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. Given our large membership size, we have become a significant target for spammers and hackers over the past few years, and this was the first hacking attempt that successfully breached our protective walls, Care2 representatives wrote on the sites blog.  The vulnerabilities which the hackers used to penetrate the sites defenses were immediately patched up to prevent further access, but the incident is still being investigated to determine the full extent of the breach.  The FBI has been contacted to investigate the matter, but so far, the only clues to point to the identity of the attackers are some IP addresses from Russia. This, however, doesnt necessarily prove that the attack was launched from there. It could be that the hackers compromised devices from this certain location.  Since no financial information is stored in the sites databases, the hackers may have targeted Care2 in order to obtain passwords which they can later use to gain access to other accounts, including ones that contain more sensitive data.  This is exactly why customers are advised not only to change their passwords on the breached site, but also on others that share the same credentials. This procedure has to be done in the shortest time since after they get their hands on the loot, the crooks will try to make the best of it before their victims get to do anything about it.  Customers who experience issues in recovering their passwords are advised to contact Care2 customer support for help.","Unknown","Other","Other Services","US","TRUE","SAMEORIGIN"

The Herald on Sunday accessed the Telecom database using login details supplied by sales staff working for rival telco Slingshot. It gave us names, addresses and billing details for every Telecom customer.  The discovery has dismayed the Privacy Commissioner Marie Shroff, who yesterday announced she would investigate.  The Herald on Sunday has spoken to five former staff of Slingshot's sales contractor, Power Marketing Limited, who say staff accessed Telecom customer details as part of their sales business. All five said they knew they were not allowed to, but it was common practice. They accessed the Telecom database, known as Wireline, from a computer in the Power Marketing offices in Newmarket, Auckland.  One former staff member said that the database, which contains an estimated 2.15 million names, gave sales staff the ability to know exactly what Telecom plans the customer was signed up to, how much was paid for the plan and whether they were tied to a contract.  It did not allow them to see customer credit card details or what numbers anyone had called. But the informant said it put Telecom customers at a disadvantage because sales staff knew their account details better than they did and customers might gain the mistaken impression they were talking to Telecom staff.  Slingshot, New Zealand's fastest growing telco, surged in popularity after it hired telemarketing company Power Marketing to cold-call potential customers. The company has previously said its sales staff brought in 160,000 new customers for Slingshot in just two years.  Telecom retail chief executive Alan Gourdie yesterday would not rule out going to the police over the security breach.  ""We're just outraged. This is our customer data - potentially fraudulently used. We will pursue this to all remedies that are available.""  He said the account details provided by the Herald on Sunday had been traced to a legitimate account used by a Telecom dealer to carry out its business. He said the inquiry had yet to discover how the account - now closed - had wound up with Power Marketing Limited.  ""When it falls into the wrong hands it can be used for commercial advantage, which is what seems to have happened. They have no rights of access to that information for whatever purpose. It is outrageous.""  Gourdie said sales tactics employed by Slingshot were under investigation by the Commerce Commission.  He said the complaint was laid by Telecom after large numbers of people complained about being signed up to deals they didn't understand - a practice known as ""slamming"".  Power Marketing Limited owner Paul Ross yesterday said: ""We use Wireline from time to time."" When asked if it was used for sales, he denied it then disconnected the call.  CallPlus chief executive Mark Callander - who oversees Slingshot - said he had quizzed Ross about Wireline and was yet to find out how the company had gained access to it. He said he had arranged to meet Ross today but said Power Marketing Limited was highly unlikely to have the right to access Telecom's customer information through Wireline. However, he said he had an assurance from Ross it was not used for sales.  ""If that is not the case there will be severe ramifications.""  He said his inquiries suggested the actions were carried out by sales staff without management knowing.  ""I'm certainly not comfortable with the activities that have been described.""","Credentials,Personal","Espionage","Information","NZ","TRUE","NULL"

According to the Mandiant report, the cyberattack, which state sources say is believed to have originated inside Russia, started with a “phishing” scheme, a common tactic used by cyber criminals.   Last Aug. 13, a hacker sent multiple South Carolina Department of Revenue  employees a malicious email containing an embedded link containing malware or a computer virus. When at least one of the employees clicked on the link, the malware was activated and allowed the hacker to steal the employee’s user name and password.  From there, the hacker was off to the races. Two weeks later, the attacker logged onto the remote-access service for Department of Revenue computers, using the credentials of an employee who had clicked on the Aug. 13 email.

Student loan borrowers affected by the hrsdc privacy breach, a Facebook group of 2,459 borrowers (as of 12:27 a.m. PST on Jan. 31), has organized with more than 250 signing a letter released on Monday, Jan. 28. The letter expresses concerns over Human Resources and Skills Development Canadas (HRSDC) latest solution to the breach, an offer of a free fraud alert flag provided by credit bureau Equifax, something HRSDC said normally costs $5. What HRSDC purchased from Equifax was a unique solution that was designed specifically for this particular incident, said Alyson Queen, HRSDC communications director. Its not the free service. This is added for six years. Were currently trying to work with other authorized financial institutions, Queen said. On Jan. 23, two days before HRSDC began offering fraud alerts through Equifax, Canadas other national credit bureau, TransUnion, began charging $5 to enable fraud alerts. Both bureaus offer credit monitoring services starting at $14.95 per month. I cant afford the $30 to $40 per month in fees for credit monitoring packages from both bureaus, UBC grad Nick Hall said. Those affected should not be out of pocket for the way the government has mishandled their information. Amanda Thoy started the Facebook group on Jan. 12, hoping to provide a forum for those affected to voice concerns. The group grew quickly and Thoy struggled to keep up with membership demand. My husband logged into the group via our laptop and I accepted requests via my iPhone, she said. We have now become more of an awareness group speaking out against HRSDC, Thoy said, asserting the departments dealings with the public had not been honest. Many Canadians are still not aware this breach has happened. Wende Donaldson, a 2001 graduate of ICT Kikkawa College in Toronto, paid the $5 fraud alert fee to Equifax before HRSDCs announcement. Now shes attempting to be reimbursed. Its the principle, she said. Someone needs to be held accountable for this. Donaldson waited 76 hours for a supervisor to call. She was told shed receive a call within 24 to 48 hours. When the supervisor finally contacted her, there was nothing he could do. By then, Donaldson said she was angry and asked the supervisor, How would you feel if this was your information out there? Many borrowers are still awaiting promised correspondence from HRSDC containing information on credit protection services offered and further information about what to do next. When one Facebook group member asked the group if anyone had received a letter, not one of the 70 respondents had. The letters are going out for everyone for whom we have current contact information, Queen said. The department stopped sending letters for a short period of time, just so that any future letters that were being sent would have information on the credit protection. The department is missing current contact information for one-third of those affected, according to Queen. Meanwhile, the federal government is facing four class-action lawsuits. Bob Buckingham Law in St. Johns, N.L. is among the firms filing. The government has 30 days to file a defence to my action and we have 90 days to file the motion to certify, Buckingham said. I hope to be quicker than that. On Nov. 5, 2012, an HRSDC employee discovered a hard drive containing the personal information of 583,000 student loan borrowers was missing. The public was notified 67 days later. The information was compiled for the purposes of a customer satisfaction survey, Queen said. There are now going to be disciplinary measures in place if employees do not follow protocol, Queen said, but could not comment on disciplinary measures over this incident. The hard drive is still deemed missing, but at this point in HRSDCs investigation, Queen reaffirmed theres no reason to believe any fraudulent activity has occurred. HRSDC is asking students to contact them to learn if theyre affected or to arrange credit protection services. Students can call 1-866-885-1866 from within North America or 1-416-572-1113 from outside.","Personal","TheftLoss","Public","CA","TRUE","NULL"

The data includes the name, address and telephone number of 3,996,789 people who had applied for accounts with KDDI's Dion Internet provider service up to Dec. 18, 2003, KDDI said. Additionally the gender, birthday and e-mail addresses of some of the people was also leaked.  KDDI is Japan's second-largest telecommunications carrier. It operates fixed-line, dial-up Internet, broadband and cellular services through a number of different companies.  The carrier became aware of the leak on May 31 this year when it received a phone call from someone claiming to possess a CD-ROM of the data, said Yoko Watanabe, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based carrier. The original source of the data has yet to be determined and Watanabe declined to comment on other aspects of the case, which is being investigated by the police, she said.  The leak is just the latest of several to hit the headlines in Japan this year. Personal information has been leaked by companies a number of times onto the Internet through viruses that infect PCs running file sharing programs. While the source of the data lost by KDDI is not yet clear, the episode is likely to increase fears of identity theft and other fraud in Japan.  In recent years the number of frauds committed against consumers using such information has been on the rise. Armed with the name and address or telephone number of a consumer, fraudsters can send out bills or make calls demanding payment for services that were never delivered.

The breach stings particularly for Ashampoo because it offers security software as part of its product portfolio.  Ashampoo chief executive Rolf Hilchner emailed customers and posted a message on the software vendors website after discovering that hackers had gained access to one of its servers.  Like many other companies, we are targeted by organisations of hackers that try to break into IT systems in order to steal data, he said. Unfortunately, one of our security systems fell victim to such an attack recently. An unauthorised access to one of our servers took place.  The company said billing information - including credit card and banking details  had not been compromised in the attack, as that data was stored on a separate system.  Hilchner nonetheless warned that hackers might attempt to use the customer information for financial gain. It could be combined with vulnerabilities in mail server systems of other companies, he said, in order to send alleged order confirmations in their name.  He cited a recent example of online retailer PurelyGadgets, which announced on Facebook that its servers were used to send bogus confirmations of orders. Hilchner said the emails contain a manipulated PDF document as an attachment that could be used to load malicious code upon execution.  Generally it is always important that you stay suspicious of unknown senders and that you do not respond to requests that tell you to open attachments, Hilchner said.  He advised customers not to open an attachment and delete any email that claimed to be a confirmation of an order from a company the customer cannot recall purchasing from.","Personal","Other","Information","DE","TRUE","NULL"

The districts governing board has already approved several million dollars for repairs, which are still being made, and on Tuesday agreed to spend up to $7 million more to notify everyone who is potentially affected, spokesman Tom Gariepy said Wednesday.  Letters will be sent to current and former students, employees and vendors of the districts 10 colleges going back at least several years to alert them that their information could have been seen, Gariepy said.  Among the vulnerable data were employees Social Security numbers, drivers-license numbers and bank-account information, he said.  Students academic information also may have been exposed, but not their personal information.  There is no evidence that any information actually was looked at or stolen, Gariepy said.  A company has been hired to handle questions and assist people who may have been affected.  The FBI notified the district on April 29 that it found a website advertising personal data from the districts information-technology system for sale, Gariepy said. The districts website was taken down that day and stayed down for several days before being restored in stages.  Gariepy said the district didnt release information about the event at the time because it was investigating the extent of the exposure.  There was a tremendous amount of data, and the forensics investigation around this was very complex, he said. They had to look at a number of different systems and servers and databases.  It would have been nice to say something earlier, but we couldnt give anyone information until we could say it with certainty, even if its not conclusive.  At the same time, the district was repairing its information-technology system and didnt want to publicize that it could be vulnerable, he said.  Gariepy said the district has installed more firewalls and security procedures. He also said some employees in the information-technology department face disciplinary action.  He would not elaborate.  We started immediate steps to make the system secure, and its become progressively more secure as time has gone on, he said.","Personal","Other","Educational","US","TRUE","NULL"

Jacqueline Menendez, vice president of communications at the university, said a vehicle used by Archive America Ltd. to transport the patient data was broken into in downtown Coral Gables, Fla., on March 17. Thieves removed a transport case carrying the school's computer backup tapes, she said.  For reasons Menendez could not explain, Archive America waited 48 hours before finally notifying the university on Mar. 19 about the break-in and theft. Officials from the transport firm couldn't be reached.  The university posted an alert about the incident on April 17, a full month after the backup tapes were stolen. In a statement, Doctor Pascal J. Goldschmidt, senior vice president for medical affairs and dean of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said, ""Even though I am confident that our patients' data is safe, we felt that in the best interest of the physician-patient relationship we should be transparent in this matter.""  Since the incident, Mendendez said that the university temporarily stopped transporting backup data off-site. ""At this point, we're not transporting anything until we conduct our own internal evaluation of the incident and see if there's anything that could have been done differently or better,"" she said.  Coral Gables law enforcement officials, who are investigating the incident, have informed the school that it was likely a ""random theft,"" Mendendez noted.  The stolen backup tapes hold names, addresses, Social Security numbers and health information all patients at university medical facilities since Jan. 1, 1999. Financial data from approximately 47,000 people may be on the missing tapes, said Mendendez. Each potential victim has been contacted by the school, she said.  After learning about the data breach, the university contacted local computer forensics companies to see if data on a similar set of backup tapes could be accessed. Menendez said security experts at Terremark Worldwide Inc. ""tried for days"" to decode the data but could not because of proprietary compression and encoding tools used to write data to the storage tapes.  ""The university feels confident that the person who took [the tapes] doesn't know what they have. Even if they do know what's contained inside, it's very difficult to extract that information,"" remarked Menendez.

Zeng has been detained on charges of illegal acquisition of computer data.  The leak occurred on December 21, 2011, exposing user names, passwords, and e-mail addresses belonging to online shopping, gaming, social networking, and even financial service websites. Police noticed that most of the leaked data dated from July 2009 to July 2010, indicating the CSDN server was hacked before July 2010, according to Shanghai Daily.  Zeng was caught in Wenzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province, on February 4, 2012 after an investigation into the case. During the inquiry, police also uncovered four other hackers doing similar deeds, and are still looking into their illegal activities. Zeng caught the police's attention because of what he posted in September 2010. He said he had gained control of the CSDN database after hacking into the CSDN server in April 2010.  After the incident, Beijing police punished CSDN for poorly securing its database. CSDN apologized to its subscribers and claimed that its server has been properly protected since September 2010. Hopefully this means it now encrypts the account details it stores, because chances are the organization will be hacked again at some point.  There are services such as PwnedList that keep track of online accounts that have been compromised, but I doubt this particular hack was recorded by this site.

The small crew of hackers had a distinct division of labor, operated with skill and efficiency and left one of the worlds larger banks holding the bag.  Viktor Pleshchuk, Sergei Tsurikov, Oleg Covelin and a fourth man, identified only as Hacker 3, pooled their talents, and with the help of a worldwide network of cashers in more than 280 cities, they were able to walk away with $9 million of RBS WorldPays money. The attack, detailed in a federal indictment announced Tuesday by the Department of Justice, illustrates clearly the level of organization and sophistication involved in ATM and payment-card fraud, as well as the difficulty banks face in guarding against these schemes.  The scam began simply and came together quickly. In early November 2008, prosecutors allege that Covelin discovered a vulnerability in the network of RBS WorldPay, a subsidiary of the Royal bank of Scotland that handles payroll and other payment-processing transactions for companies around the world. Covelin took his find to Tsurikov, who in turn brought in Pleshchuk, the man who had the technical skills to exploit the vulnerability. Tsurikov allegedly acted as a kind of social director throughout the scheme, bringing together various people, matching up a need with a skill set.  On Nov. 5, Covelin allegedly gave Pleshchuk a username and password for a server on the RBS network in Georgia. Once inside the RBS WorldPay network, the hackers, led by Pleshchuk, allegedly gained access to a database containing the account numbers and PINs of payroll debit cards that the companys customers give to their employees in lieu of live paychecks or direct deposits. The cards allow employees to withdraw funds directly from ATMs, up to a pre-set limit, or buy merchandise from approved vendors.  The indictment does not spell out the exact structure of the database that the hackers allegedly compromised and makes no mention of encryption of the data set. But, the attackers were able to get both the debit card account numbers and the PINs associated with those accounts. Its unclear whether the account numbers and PINs were stored together. After getting that data, Pleschchuk, Tsurikov and Hacker 3 allegedly went in and jacked up the amount of money available on the debit cards and raised the withdrawal limits on the cards, as well. The trio then sent 44 prepaid payroll card numbers and PINs to a pre-arranged network of cashers. Typically, someone in these networks takes the numbers and PINs and creates a fake card programmed with the data.  Then, just three days after the crews first foray into the banks network, on Nov. 8, cashers in 280 cities around the world began hitting ATM machines, withdrawing predetermined amounts at each one and then moving on to another terminal.  Within 12 hours, the crew had stolen more than $9 million from RBS WorldPay, a massive one-day loss even for a company the size of RBS.  Meanwhile, Pleschchuk and Tsurikov allegedly went back into RBS WorldPays network to monitor the activity while the cashers were making their rounds, ensuring that the mules did their jobs. The hackers were letting the cashers keep a sizable portion of their withdrawalsbetween 30 and 50 percentso they wanted to know exactly how much money would be coming their way.  After the attack was over, Pleshchuk and Tsurikov allegedly went into the RBS WorldPay database logs and began deleting any information that would point to their scheme, according to the indictment. But the crew apparently didnt do a very good job of covering its tracks. Security officials at RBS WorldPay noticed the fraudulent transactions quickly and reported them to law enforcement. And now, Pleschchuk, Tsurikov, Colevin and Hacker 3, along with four alleged co-conspirators, Igor Grudijev, Ronald Tsoi, Evelin Tsoi, Mihhail Jevgenov, are facing federal charges and several years in prison for their trouble.","Personal","Webapp","Finance","GB","TRUE","SAMEORIGIN"

We intend to get to the bottom of this, and we will take aggressive steps to protect and assist anyone whose information may have been involved.""

The hard drive was used to back up information contained on the employee's office computer, and may have contained data from research projects the employee was involved in. The employee also indicated the hard drive may have contained personal identifying information on some veterans, but asserts that portions of the data were protected. Investigators are still working to determine the scope of the information potentially involved.  On January 23, VA's IG was notified the external hard drive was missing. The OIG opened a criminal investigation, sent special agents to the medical center, and notified the FBI. VA's Office of Information & Technology in Washington, D.C. also dispatched an incident response team to investigate.  The OIG has seized the employee's work computer and is in the process of analyzing its contents. VA IT staff is providing technical support in this effort. Analyzing the work computer may help investigators determine the nature of the information the hard drive potentially contained.  Pending results of the investigation, VA is prepared to send individual notifications and provide one year of free credit monitoring to those whose information proves compromised.

State and federal class action lawsuits filed earlier this week allege that the Board was negligent when it distributed more than 100 computer disks containing Social Security numbers and other personal data on more than 1.3 million voters to alderman and ward committee members.  The 11-page state and six-page federal lawsuits ask the court to force the board to recover the disks and erase the data on them. The lawsuits, which seek unspecified monetary damages, also call on the board to notify affected individuals of the breach.  ""What we'd like to see is some sort of an endowment, similar to what the [Department of Veterans Affairs] did last year, for people whose credit might have been damaged by this,"" said Nick Kefalos an attorney with Chicago-based Vernor Moran who filed the lawsuits.  Jim Allen, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said that about 100 computer disks containing voter information were distributed to aldermen and committee members in late 2003 and early 2004. The information was distributed under an Illinois state law that requires election authorities to make available reports on registered voters to aldermen, election candidates and ward committees, Allen said.  Typically, the data that's made available by the election authority does not include the Social Security numbers of registered voters, Allen said. In this case, disks were created using data that was downloaded directly from the board's mainframes after a 2003 fire at the Cook County Administration Building forced an evacuation of the building for several months.  ""They had to do a massive download because they were not going to have access to the mainframes for several months,"" he said. That data included the Social Security numbers of over 1.3 million voters out of the 2.2 million registered voters in the city, and was ""unfortunately included with the basic information"" made available.  Allen added that the election board has hand-delivered letters on Monday to ward offices requesting the disks to be returned. He added that so far there is no indication that any of the information has been used for fraudulent purposes.  Since the board moved back to the Cook County building, it has not been including any Social Security numbers with the information sent out, Allen said.  The breach was brought to the board's attention last month by Peter Zelchenko, who is running for an alderman's position in an election set for Feb. 27. Zelchenko is part of a group called the Illinois Ballot Integrity Project, and last October he disclosed a major breach on the Chicago Election board's Web site. That breach not only allowed users to view the Social Security numbers of registered voters but to also actually edit and delete the information.  Since that disclosure, the board has removed the Social Security numbers from public view and deleted all but the last four digits of the numbers from its mainframe records, Allen said. It also hired a local firm, Grant Thornton LLP, to help deal with data security and storage issues as well as the control and dissemination of data.  Following the disclosure of the latest breach, Zelchenko, created a Web site designed to help voters determine exactly what information might have been included in the disks that were handed out.  Regarding the latest breach, Zelchenko said it was ""far worse"" than the problem he disclosed in October. ""There is now not one path to the information, but easily hundreds, on hundreds of CD-ROMs distributed over the years,"" he said.  ""Essentially, you can select from among 2.2 million Chicagoans and know their full name, current and past addresses, family members' identities, birthdate, sex, phone number, Social Security numbers, and what years they voted. You couldn't plan a more ideal package for identity theft,"" he said.","Personal","Error","Public","US","TRUE","NULL"

The court ordered Herve Falciani's release on the prosecutor's recommendation, which argues that Falciani was co-operating with authorities in several European countries in investigations on tax, money-laundering, corruption and terrorism financing. The prosecutor noted Falciani has been detained for some time and that his extradition case could drag on.  He was ordered to hand over his passport, not to leave Spain and to appear before police every three days. He was also told to establish a residence in Spain and to inform authorities if he moved house.  Falciani, a French-Italian citizen, has been jailed provisionally since being arrested July 1 in Barcelona on a Swiss warrant. He had previously fled Switzerland to France.  The data he allegedly stole about 24,000 customers of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary potentially exposed many people to prosecution by tax authorities in their home countries.  Falciani, who obtained the information between late 2006 and early 2007 when he worked in the bank's information technology development unit, passed the list to French authorities. France's former Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, now head of the International Monetary Fund, later relayed the list to many European Union countries and the United States.

Along with medical records, the hard drive contains names, addresses and Social Security numbers of Health Net customers from Arizona, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Connecticut has data breach laws requiring individuals be notified of the loss of their personal data without reasonable delay.  The data loss, which occurred in May, was only reported by the insurance company to the Connecticut state attorney general's office and the Department of Insurance yesterday. The device containing the data was an external, portable hard drive. The data had not been encrypted.  Health Net, based in Shelton, Conn., had no information about the data breach on its Web site .  Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his office is investigating the data breach. ""Health Net's incomprehensible foot-dragging demonstrates shocking disregard for patients' financial security, as well as loss of their highly sensitive and confidential personal health information,"" he said in a statement.

The state's insurance commissioner, Thomas Sullivan, said he is requiring Health Net to offer credit protection monitoring through Debix, a company that provides identity-theft protection services.  According to a statement by Health Net, the information on the drive was saved in an image format that cannot be read without special software. Health Net plans to send letters to its customers officially notifying them of the incident.  ""Protecting the privacy of our members is extremely important to us,"" Health Net said. ""We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this may cause our members.""

Among the Connecticut consumers are depositors and investors of People's United Bank of Bridgeport, which gave Bank of New York Mellon the information so it could offer those consumers an investment opportunity.  Blumenthal today wrote Bank of New York Mellon, which lost the information in February, demanding that it provide affected consumers with credit monitoring and other identity theft protections, as well as a full account of how the loss occurred and other information.  The banks have cooperated fully thus far with Blumenthal's office.  Consumers seeking information about the breach should call a toll free number set up by Bank of New York Mellon, (877) 278-3451.  ""I am alarmed and deeply concerned by a recent and serious data breach at The Bank of New York Mellon ('BNY') involving the loss of computer backup tapes containing sensitive information of some 4.5 million consumers, including People's United Bank account holders and shareowners,"" Blumenthal said in his letter. ""Several hundred thousand Connecticut citizens may be affected, and possibly more, by this loss of highly significant personal information.  ""This security breach seems highly dangerous, indeed possibly devastating in light of the identity theft threat. You have also informed this office that BNY began notifying the affected customers six weeks ago and is offering one year of credit monitoring through Equifax. Given this extraordinarily serious security breach, this offer of protection is grossly inadequate. Connecticut agencies that have experienced data security breaches less serious in magnitude or potential damage have offered consumers two years of credit monitoring, $25,000 identity theft insurance and free credit freezes. BNY should do no less.  ""I am especially concerned by the delay in informing consumers, possibly heightening the risks of wrongdoing. Neither People's nor its customers were promptly notified. Even now, many may be in the dark.  ""The loss of this tape -- so far unrecovered and unremedied -- is inexplicable and unacceptable. It must be addressed by protective measures to forestall identity theft immediately.""  On February 27, Bank of New York Mellon gave the unencrypted backup tape containing information on about 4.5 million consumers -- hundreds of thousands of them People's United Bank customers and investors -- and nine other tapes to a storage firm, Archive Systems, Inc., for transportation to a storage facility. When the storage company vehicle arrived at the storage facility, the tape was missing. The other nine tapes reached the facility safely.  People's United Bank informed Blumenthal's office of the breach earlier this week, shortly after New York Bank of Mellon informed it.

The laptop contained patient names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, medical record numbers, and health insurance plan providers on 3.3 million patients who used Sutter Physician Services, a provider of billing services for healthcare providers.

On Thursday, Nexon found that Maple Storys backup server had been hacked, and personal information of 13.2 million of the 18 million registered users stolen.  The company reported the incident to the Korea Communications Commission at about 5 p.m. on Friday and requested the police to investigate the incident.  According to Nexon, the hacker gained access to names, game IDs, resident registration numbers and passwords of the 13.2 million users.  The resident registration numbers and passwords were stored in codified form, the company said.  The investigations are ongoing and police are leaving open the possibility that an insider was behind the hacking or that those responsible had inside help.  Authorities will also determine if the server has been affected by malware, and track the route the malware was implanted in the server if any such programs are found.  The investigations are ongoing, so we cant disclose details about the situation, a Nexon official said. He added that the number of minors affected by the hacking cannot be disclosed and that the number of those who registered to the service using i-Pin codes instead of resident registration numbers is unknown.  A Nexon official is seen at the companys office on in Seoul on Sunday, two days after the company and the Korea Communications Commission announced that a hacking incident occurred on Thursday.

The information concerning legal guardians of users who are under 14 years of age is not involved in the hacking as it is stored in a different server.  Users younger than 14 are required to obtain consent from legal guardians, who are to fill in information to prove their relation with user.  The KCC said that while it is unlikely that codified information could immediately be misused, details will not be known before the system analysis is complete.

According to Benesse Holdings Inc., the data not only dealt with customers of the subsidiarys mainstay education services, but also information related to the firms lifestyle business services collected at its events and other occasions.  The leaked data was stored in a smartphone used by a system engineer arrested last week for allegedly copying trade secrets from the company, Chikara Matsumoto, chief risk management officer of Benesse Holdings, said at a news conference.  So far, it is known that personal information on some 23 million people leaked from the subsidiary.  Benesse Corp. said Monday that data on some 22.6 million people was found on the systems engineers smartphone. In addition, information on some 400,000 people was leaked through unconfirmed channels.  The police investigation isnt complete, which means further data leaks could come to light.  Initially, Benesse Holdings said that information on up to some 20.7 million customers might have been compromised based on lists obtained from name-list brokers.  The corporate group then found that user information was compromised at the Benesse LifeSmile Shop, an online shopping site for pregnant women and mothers, and Benesse Womens Park, a social networking site for women.  The newly found data include the estimated due dates of some 200,000 babies.  Tokyo police arrested Masaomi Matsuzaki, 39, last Thursday on suspicion of downloading and copying the personal data of Benesse customers onto his smartphone from the Tokyo branch of affiliate Synform Co.  Authorities seized the smartphone and a memory card from Matsuzaki and matched data on the phone and storage device with Benesse customer information.  Matsuzaki admitted selling the data to name-list traders and gambled away the money, according to the police.  Also Tuesday, Benesse Holdings convened a panel of experts to begin investigating the steps leading up to the theft and draft measures to prevent future data leaks. The panel, headed by lawyer Hideaki Kobayashi, will also investigate the responsibilities of the firms compliance officers, the company said.","Personal","Misuse","Management","JP","TRUE","NULL"

The lost data includes Social Security numbers and account information that could make customers of a federal government charge card program vulnerable to identity theft.   Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., is among those senators whose personal information is on the missing tapes, spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said.  There were some senators Visa credit card accounts involved, Schmaler said. We dont know how many, but he was one of them.  The bank issued an apology.  We deeply regret this unfortunate incident, said Barbara Desoer, who is in charge of technology, service and fulfillment for the Charlotte-based bank. The privacy of customer information receives the highest priority at Bank of America, and we take our responsibilities for safeguarding it very seriously.  The bank will be sending letters to people whose private information was on the tapes -- probably hundreds of thousands of letters, according to Bank of America spokeswoman Alexandra Trower. While there were 1.2 million accounts on the tapes, some individuals had multiple accounts, she said.  Privacy incidents are keeping the U.S. Postal Service busy lately. Just last week, a security breach at ChoicePoint Corp. led to that company sending 145,000 letters to exposed consumers.   Leahy has been a leader of calls this week for a Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry into whether more regulation of companies that buy and sell personal data is needed.  That came after the disclosure that ChoicePoint Inc., a data warehouser, had learned that as many as 140,000 consumers may have had their personal information compromised.  I hope this latest incident at least will bring the issue closer to home so Congress will pay better attention to the rapid erosion of privacy rights that ordinary Americans are facing as more and more of their personal and financial information is collected and sold on databases that too often have too few privacy protections, Leahy said in a statement Friday.  Baggage handlers suspected U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was told the data backup tapes were likely stolen off of a commercial plane by baggage handlers in December.  Whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions, he said.  Bank spokeswoman Eloise Hale called the system of shipping backup tapes an industry practice and a routine bank practice. As a safety precaution measure, backup tapes are stored in different locations.  She declined to give any more details about where and how the tapes are moved around the country.  The missing tapes include information on federal employees who use Bank of America smart pay charge cards for travel and expenses, Hale said Friday.  She said federal law enforcement officials were notified as soon as the tapes were discovered missing.  The investigation to date has found no evidence to suggest the tapes or their content have been accessed or misused, and the tapes are now presumed lost, the bank said in a news release.  Trower said the company would not comment on the format of the data on the tapes -- and wouldn't say if the data was encrypted -- but she said it would be ""virtually impossible"" for anyone who found the tapes to access the data.","Payment,Personal","TheftLoss","Finance","US","TRUE","NULL"

Montreal man arrested in Bell Canada data theft case  Bell Canada Enterprises says it has recovered the stolen data relating to 3.4 million Ontario and Quebec customers with help from the Montreal police.  A 30-year-old Montreal man was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the incident.  Bell says it was tipped off by an informant mid-January that its security had been breached.  Our security and our forensic technology teams are combing through the data and determining precisely whats part of [the breach], Mark Langton, Bell spokesperson told ITBusiness.ca.  The unidentified suspect is not a former Bell employee, he adds.  (Security experts note that while threats from outside the enterprise have increased in the last couple of years  insiders still pose a more serious risk than outsiders).  Bell says its ongoing investigation prevents it from revealing how the suspect got his hands on the electronic information.  It was on a hard drive and on a memory stick and on a CD, Langton explains. It was all electronic, there was no other format.  The data consisted of names, addresses, phone numbers, a list of services received and long-distance calling details.  About five per cent of the numbers were unlisted, and affected customers will be contacted by Bell, Langton says.  He says no financial information  such as PIN numbers or credit card numbers  was included in the stolen data.  The suspect was charged with unauthorized use of a computer, and released, and will require to come to court on April 10 to face the charges, according to Oliver Lapointe, a spokesperson for the Montreal Police.  The investigation is not over and were looking for other potential suspects, Lapointe adds.  Bell corporate security was tipped off when the suspect allegedly tried to sell customer data to the informant.  The team applied for the right of search and seizure of the data, and police got an arrest warrant at the same time.  The information was of interest for marketing purposes, not fraud, Lapointe says.  Canadian companies can do more to guard confidential customer information, says David Senf, director of Canadian security and software research at Toronto-based IDC Canada.  Organizations in Canada have a rough idea of what security threats can harm them, he says. But when it comes down to specifics, of which threat is the one they need to focus on, thats where we see trouble.  Bell, however, has defended its data security procedures in a press release.  Protecting the privacy of customer information is of prime importance to Bell, the release said. The company has strict policies and procedures and sophisticated security systems in place to protect that information.  Bell spokesperson Langton couldnt think of a similar incident ever occurring at Bell, and believes this is a first-time event.  But he says the breach could mean a review is needed.  Its frustrating, but well be looking at our entire security system, he says.  Hackers will continue to prey on companies as well as individuals who dont protect their information, Senf says, whether its en masse theft, or piece-by-piece collection from social networking sites.  Its no longer hackers having fun, he says. Its someone who wants to make a dollar going after the information.","Personal","Other","Information","CA","TRUE","NULL"

The compromised information contained the names and Social Security and bank routing numbers of students, teachers, staff and retirees.  Hackers also stole 200,000 records of people who may never have attended or set foot on the Niceville campus in Okaloosa County.

Among the employees, about 50 have reported having their identity stolen or funds taken from bank accounts used for direct deposit.  The breach occurred sometime between late May and late September. The school notified the public on Monday. It was discovered during an internal review from Oct. 1 through Oct. 5.  The school's president, Ty Handy, was among the employees victimized, the school said.  ""We know that from May 21, 2012, until Sept. 24, 2012, one or more hackers accessed one folder on our main server. This folder had multiple files on it.

""However, by working between files, the hacker(s) have been able to piece together enough information to be able to engage in identity theft for at least 50 employees.""  Handy said officials believe the breach was a coordinated attack by one or a group of hackers. After pulling together information from separate files, the hackers have already taken out personal loans that debit bank accounts through PayDayMax, Inc. and Discount Advance Loans.

The information was released on Tuesday on Pastebin by a self-proclaimed Egyptian hacker named ""ViruS_HimA."" The hacker, who claimed the database accessed holds more than 150,000 records, posted links to several websites hosting a text file with 230 records.  ""We have seen the claim and are investigating,"" said Wiebke Lips, senior manager with Adobe's corporate communications.  The hacker only released records with email addresses ending in ""adobe.com,"" "".mil"" and "".gov.""  A look at the 230 records showed the full names, titles, organizations, email addresses, usernames and encrypted passwords of users in a variety of U.S. government agencies, including the departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the U.S. State Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and state-level agencies, among others.  The published passwords are MD5 hashes, or cryptographic representations, of the actual plain-text passwords. It's a good security practice to only store hashes rather than the plain-text passwords, but those hashes can be converted back to their original state using free password-cracking tools and enough computing power.  Shorter passwords are easier to crack, especially if they contain no special characters and are, for example, just a word composed of lower-case letters. Many MD5 hashes that have already been reversed are available in lists freely available on the internet.  Some of the MD5 hashes released in the text file revealed simple passwords. That's particularly dangerous given that people tend to reuse passwords for other services. Hackers will typically try to use stolen credentials on sites such as Facebook and Twitter to see if they're valid.  Given that the data released on Tuesday includes names and organizations, hackers could act fast in an attempt to steal other information.  An email request for an interview with ViruS_HimA wasn't immediately returned. The hacker wrote there's another data leak soon to be released from Yahoo.

People across all seven campuses who attended IU from 2011-2014 are potentially at risk.  University officials say the problem wasnt a technical one, but rather human error. The Student Services database was supposed to be in an encrypted location, but instead it was being stored in an insecure location.  An employee discovered the issue last week, and IU spokesman Mark Land says the university quickly secured the data the following day.  Land says no humans have seen the data; it was not downloaded by anyone looking for sensitive information. However, the data did get picked up by a web crawler that mines information to improve web search capabilities.  In a statement, James Kennedy, associate vice president for financial aid and university student services and system, said the incident was not a targeted attack to obtain data for illegal purposes.  And we believe the chance of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands as a result of this situation is remote, said Kennedy. At the same time, we have moved quickly to secure the data and are conducting a thorough investigation into our information handling process to ensure that this doesnt happen again.

The company, which makes the World Of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo franchises posted a message on its website today advising players using North American servers to change their passwords for the account management service.  The compromised data relates to Battle.net accounts which are used for all of Blizzard's games.  In a posting today the company said: This week, our security team found an unauthorized and illegal access into our internal network here at Blizzard. We quickly took steps to close off this access and began working with law enforcement and security experts to investigate what happened.  The post goes on to explain that the data that was illegally accessed included a list of email addresses for global Battle.net users outside of China.  Players on North America servers (which includes users in North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia), had their security question details hacked as well as information relating to Mobile and Dial-In authentication.  Cryptographically scrambled Battle.net passwords were also taken.  The company has advised that gamers that play online via North American servers should change their passwords as a precaution.  The company has stressed it would be extremely difficult to access actual passwords using the scrambled data stolen.  They also stressed that no financial data had been accessed, such as credit cards or billing addresses.  Blizzard said that users should be aware of any potential phishing scams that may follow as a consequence of email details being out in the open.  Blizzard Entertainment boss Mike Morhaime said the hack had been discovered on August 4th, and that the company were:  truly sorry that this has happened.  The company said it had spent the time since August 4th fixing the vulnerability in their systems and finding out what information had been compromised.  Following the hack the company is likely to face criticism over its decision to make games that require a login via Battle.net and cannot be played offline.  Despite the loss of passwords and email data Blizzard's use of a Secure Remote Password protocol is likely to have minimised the consequences for users as the system makes it near impossible to brute-force a password, a method hackers use in which a computer attempts every possible key or password until it succeeds.

James Kevin Real was also ordered to pay back the more than $32,000 that he and accomplice Laray Byrd fraudulently withdrew from customer accounts between May and July of last year using those counterfeit debit cards.  The Compass Bank compromise is one of the largest bank-related breaches yet revealed, in terms of the number of customer records that were potentially exposed. The incident, however, appears to have surfaced for the first time only after the Birmingham News carried a story on the sentencing last week.  Ed Bilek, a spokesman for the bank, said today that Real had used the information stolen from Compass Bank's database to create about 250 counterfeit debit cards. He was able to use about 45 of those cards to access and withdraw cash from customer accounts at the bank before he was arrested.  Court records associated with the case did not mention precisely how many customer records Real stole. But Bilek today said that the database on the hard drive Real stole contained ""limited information"" on about 1 million Compass Bank customers. He added that the records in the database were in a format that was not ""readily usable"" for committing fraud or for accessing customer account information easily. As a result, apart from the 250 or so individuals from whose accounts Real fraudulently withdrew money, no other customers were notified of the incident, Bilek said.  Bilek did not offer a clarification of what the bank meant when it said the data was stored in a format that was not ""readily usable.""  As of this February, Alabama was just one of 11 states that do not require companies to automatically notify consumers of data breaches involving the compromise of their personal data. In states that do require such notification, Compass Bank would have been required to notify all 1 million customers of the potential compromise of their data, if the information had been stored in unencrypted form on the stolen hard disk.  Some states even provide for penalties for companies that fail to promptly notify consumers of data breaches involving their personal data.  According to court documents, Real stole Compass' database information in May 2007. The database included customer names, account numbers and passwords. He then used the information from the database to make counterfeit debit cards using a magnetic strip encoder and software purchased by Byrd. Between June and July 2007, the pair proceeded to use the counterfeit cards to access Compass customer accounts and withdraw funds from them, typically in amounts not exceeding $500 or so. The documents show that Real would wear disguises when making the ATM withdrawals -- in fact he was apprehended while wearing one.  Real pleaded guilty last year to a 14-count charge that included fraud as well as the use of unauthorized access devices and aggravated identity theft.","Bank,Credentials","TheftLoss","Finance","US","TRUE","NULL"

Executives at Citigroup said the tapes were picked up by U.P.S. early in May and had not been seen since.  The tapes contained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, account numbers, payment histories and other details on small personal loans made to millions of customers through CitiFinancial's network of more than 1,800 lending branches, or through retailers whose product financing was handled by CitiFinancial's retail services division.  The company said there was no indication that the tapes had been stolen or that any of the data in them had been compromised.  It was, however, the latest in a series of recent data-security failures involving nearly every kind of institution that compiles personal information - ranging from data brokers like ChoicePoint and LexisNexis to financial institutions like Bank of America and Wachovia to the media giant Time Warner to universities like Boston College and the University of California, Berkeley.  All these institutions have reported data breaches in the last five months, affecting millions of individuals and spurring Congressional hearings and numerous bills aimed at improving security in the handling of sensitive consumer information. The fear is that Social Security numbers, when combined with a consumer's name, address and date of birth, can be used by thieves to open new lines of credit, secure loans and otherwise steal someone's identity.  Whether the recently reported breaches indicate an epidemic of data loss is unclear. Many privacy and security advocates have suggested that a California law, requiring that consumers be notified of data security breaches, has led to more confessions of data losses and increased awareness of a longstanding problem.  ""I think what we're seeing is a situation that's been going on for a long time,"" said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego, ""and one which has only been made visible by California's law.""  The California law, which went into effect in July 2003, requires state government agencies as well as companies and nonprofit organizations - regardless of where in the country they do business - to notify California customers if the personal information maintained in their data files has been compromised.  Yet in an age of transnational banks, Internet commerce and giant data aggregators, notifying only California residents when data on consumers all over the country is potentially lost or compromised has proved to be a public relations impossibility. (ChoicePoint was widely accused of planning to notify only California residents when it learned that information on at least 145,000 Americans had fallen into the hands of thieves; the company, however, said it was planning on nationwide notification all along.)  Now, with each week bringing new reports of data loss, whether because tapes fell off the back of a U.P.S. truck or because data was electronically stolen by hackers or thieves, at least five other states - Arkansas, North Dakota, Georgia, Montana and Washington - have passed similar notification laws. As of last month, dozens of other states were considering similar laws.  In the most recent incident, Citigroup executives say the box containing the tapes was handed over to U.P.S., along with other items for shipping, on May 2, under ""special security procedures"" that the bank required of the courier. One of those special procedures, said Citigroup's chief operations and technology officer, Debby Hopkins, included scanning the bar code on each package, rather than scanning only the single bar code on the shipment manifest, which is a summary document listing all the packages being moved in one shipment.  According to Ms. Hopkins, just the summary document was scanned for the box, which was picked up in Weehawken, N.J., so U.P.S. was unable to track where in the delivery chain the box was lost. It was not until May 20 that an employee of Experian, the credit reporting agency that was to receive the tapes, called CitiFinancial to report that they had not arrived at Experian's data-processing center in Allen, Tex. An investigation by U.P.S. failed to locate the package.  CitiFinancial has notified the Secret Service, which is called whenever there is a compromise of financial data. The agency is investigating the incident, and CitiFinancial has begun sending letters to all 3.9 million customers advising them of the loss and offering them 90 days of free enrollment in a credit-monitoring service. Other institutions with data-loss problems have also offered free credit-monitoring services, some for as long as a year.  A spokesman for U.P.S., Norman Black, would not go into specifics on where or how the security system broke down, but said the courier was continuing its investigation. Mr. Black said blame ultimately lay with his company.  ""They tendered us a package and expected it to be delivered in the reliable way that we always do,"" he said, ""and we had to go back to them and tell them that we can't find it.""  Mr. Black said that an exhaustive search of all U.P.S. facilities nationwide had turned up no sign of the package. ""It's rare that it gets to the point where we can find no trace of it,"" he said.  A spokesman for Experian, Donald A. Girard, said he had never seen an instance of a shipment of this kind simply disappearing, although he added that he and other credit agencies had been encouraging financial institutions to convert from tapes to encrypted electronic delivery of data.  ""Experian has been actively working for quite a while with all major data contributors to convert to electronic data transference,"" Mr. Girard said, ""to mitigate risk in this process.""  Ms. Hopkins of Citigroup said that most of the company's divisions already did this, and that the CitiFinancial unit is scheduled to convert to such electronic transfers in July.  She also said that the missing tapes, which were not encrypted, were created using mainframe-type computers and highly specialized hardware and software that would make it difficult - though not impossible - to extract data from them.  And Ms. Givens of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse said, ""Your everyday dumpster diver may not know what to do with these tapes, but if these tapes ever find their way into the hands of an international crime ring, I think they'll figure it out.""

Documents such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, grades and financial aid information dated back to the spring semester of 1985.  The breach included information of about 650,000 students, alumni and applicants, however, once it was discovered by a technical staff member at the university last May, it was shut down within hours. Immediately after the breach was detected, university officials contacted the students whose bank account information was stored in the school system, according to the source.","Personal","Webapp","Educational","US","TRUE","NULL"

The Dec. 2 attack was widely publicized shortly after it occurred, but in a notice filed with the New Hampshire Attorney General, CheckFree disclosed that it was warning many more customers than previously thought.  That's because CheckFree is not only notifying users of its own CheckFree.com Web site of the breach, it is also working with banks to contact people who tried to pay bills from banks that use the CheckFree bill payment service.  ""The 5 million people who were notified about the CheckFree redirection were a combination of two groups,"" said Melanie Tolley, vice president of communications at CheckFree's parent company, Fiserv Inc., in a statement. ""1.) those who we were able to identify who had attempted to pay bills from our client's bill pay sites and minus those who actually completed sessions on our site, and 2.) anyone enrolled in mycheckfree.com.""  Tolley wouldn't say what banks were affected by the hack, but the majority of these 5 million customers were CheckFree's own users, she said. In total, about 42 million customers access CheckFree's bill payment site, she said.  Customers who went to CheckFree's Web sites between 12:35 a.m. and 10:10 a.m. on the day of the attack were redirected to a Ukrainian Web server that used malicious software to try and install a password-stealing program on the victim's computer.  The criminals were able to take control of several CheckFree Web domains after logging into the company's Internet domain registrar, Network Solutions, and changing the CheckFree DNS settings. This same technique was used by hackers one year ago to take control of Comcast's Web site. It is not clear how the attackers were able to get CheckFree's Network Solutions password, but some security experts believe that CheckFree may have fallen prey to a phishing attack.  Looking at typical Web site traffic patterns, Fiserv guesses that about 160,000 consumers were exposed to the Ukrainian attack site, but not all of these customers would have been infected. For the attack to work, the victim would have to be a PC user without antivirus software who was also using an out-of-date version of Adobe Acrobat. Because of these conditions, Fiserv believes that ""a very small number"" of people were affected, Tolley said.  However, because the company lost control of its Web domains, it doesn't know exactly who was hit. And so it must warn a much larger number of customers.","Personal","Webapp","Information","US","TRUE","NULL"

Additionally, the health-care system, which was already in the process of an independent assessment of its information systems, has taken additional steps to safeguard its records as a result of the theft.  Although it is unlikely that information on the tapes will be compromised, we are nevertheless taking aggressive steps to protect our patients confidentiality, said Lorris Betz, M.D., Ph.D, Senior Vice President for Health Sciences.   A metal box containing the backup tapes, which contained billing records for approximately 2.2 million patients and guarantors, was stolen on Monday, June 2, from a car belonging to a driver who worked for an independent storage company contracted by the health-care system. The driver violated the protocols his company had established to ensure secure data transportation.   The Salt Lake County Sheriffs Department, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service are investigating the theft.  The investigation indicates that the theft was probably a random car burglary, and there is no evidence that the information on the tapes has been accessed or used for identity theft, said Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder.  Having concluded the first phase of our investigation, we believe it is now time to bring this issue to the publics attention so that we can enlist their help in recovering the tapes.  The University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics is offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the tapes, no questions asked.  Those wishing to claim the reward may call the Sheriffs Department at (801) 743-7000.  The billing records included patient names, related demographic information and diagnostic codes.  None of the records contained credit card information.  Records for a subset of 1.3 million patients also contained Social Security numbers.  The company contracted by the university to transport and store the tapes, Perpetual Storage Inc., said this is the first and only such incident in its 40-year history.  It also said that the employee who left the tapes in his car had been with the company for nearly 18 years.  Nevertheless, The University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics has suspended deliveries of backup tapes to Perpetual Storage pending the review of all procedures and protocols for transporting and storing backup data.  Additionally, the health-care system is taking the following steps on behalf of its 2.2 million patients.      Mailing notification letters to all 2.2 million patients and guarantors;     Providing free credit monitoring and restoration service to patients whose records included Social Security numbers;     Providing a toll-free information line at 1-866-581-3599 to respond to questions; and     Establishing a website at http://healthcare.utah.edu/billingrecordstheft that provides information and resources.

Co. disclosed this week that the intruders who stole up to 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers from the grocer's systems did so by planting malware programs on servers at each of its stores in New England, New York and Florida.  The malicious software was used to intercept the payment card data as the information was being transmitted from Hannaford's point-of-sale systems to authorize transactions, the company said in a letter sent to Massachusetts officials on Tuesday. The malware then forwarded the stolen card numbers as well as their expiration dates to an overseas destination, according to the letter, which was signed by Emily Dickinson, Hannaford's general counsel.  The discovery of the mass malware installation prompted a wholesale replacement of Hannaford's store servers. Dickinson's letter said that with help from the U.S. Secret Service and IT security vendors, the company has identified and replaced all of the affected hardware ""and otherwise ensured that no versions of the malware remain anywhere on the company's systems.""  The letter offered no explanation as to how the perpetrators might have gained access to each of the company's servers to plant the malicious code on them. Echoing separate comments by Hannaford officials, Dickinson wrote that the grocer was certified both last year and on Feb. 27 as being compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI.  The Hannaford breach, which the company disclosed on March 17, is among the first large-scale intrusions involving the interception of card data while it's in transit between systems, said Mike Paquette, chief strategy officer at Top Layer Networks, a vendor of intrusion-prevention systems in Westboro, Mass. Most of the compromises reported thus far have involved information stored in databases on systems or in storage devices, Paquette said.  Based on the information available so far, the initial intrusion into Hannaford's systems could have happened in several ways, Paquette added. One likely scenario, he said, is that the attackers took advantage of an undetected remotely exploitable vulnerability in one of the company's servers to gain a foothold on its network and then planted the malicious code on all of the store servers.  It's also possible that the perpetrators were able to break into Hannaford's servers because of overly permissive firewall rules or because the grocer's antivirus software failed, said Chris Andrew, vice president of security technology at software vendor Lumension Security Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz.  Another possibility, Andrew said, is that someone  even an insider  could have had physical access to a server and planted the malicious code on it, then replicated the malware across the entire Hannaford environment. Many retailers use a standard software image on all of their servers, he said  so if one system has a security weakness, it's likely that the others would as well.","Payment","POS","Retail","US","TRUE","NULL"

In this case, a (now-former) employee allegedly used a co-workers credentials to access a database to which he already had authorized access.

When he came under suspicion in March, he reportedly turned the CD over to the company. And therein may lie the prosecutorial rub:      Under the law regulating illegal access to information via computer networks, it is not considered illegal for an individual with the right to access certain information to take this information with them in another form. However, it bans individuals accessing such information using somebody elses ID or other personal data without permission.  So there may be no charges of data theft, and had he used his own credentials, he might not be facing any charges at all?

The Citigroup hack attack is the latest in a long string of reported security breach this year against various companies. Stolen from Citigroup, one of the world's largest banks with 21 million U.S. customers, is bankcard holders' names, account numbers, and contact information such as e-mail addresses. The only good news is social security numbers, birth dates, and card verification codes were stored on non-compromised systems, Citi says. The hack occurred in early May and the company only came clean when the Financial Times broke the story this morning (registration required). Citi says it is in contact with law enforcement officials.  Why Citi was Quiet About Hack Citigroup Hack Nabs Data from 210k Customers Ondrej Krehel's, Chief Information Security Officer for data risk management firm Identity Theft 911, says delaying the release of details is sometimes necessary and ""depends on multiple factors, including forensic investigations discovering the scope of the hack and what data's been taken. Law enforcement can also request a delay. Each state statue has different notification requirements, however.""  Speaking to Reuters, a Citi representative said the company has ""implemented enhanced procedures"" to avoid the hack happening again.  Citi says it's contacted customers affected but despite the statement that only credit card details were stolen, the Financial Times says it's spoken to individuals who've had their debit cards cancelled too. The first customers knew was when their cards were declined at retail outlets -- embarrassing, and hardly the best way to learn of such things.  2011: The Year of the Hack? There's been a wave of hack attacks on high-profile targets recently, such as Sony, Gmail and defense contractor Lockheed Martin, but the hacking of a bank is a rarity. Bank websites usually employ bullet-proof security, Krehel says.  ""These portals are constantly monitored and scanned internally for open vulnerabilities. However, hackers who discover just one open hole get access. Corporations perform many technical assessments to measure and close their exposure, but it seems that hackers still find ways to exploit the systems.""  Hacking is Evolving into Something Different  Hackers appearing to be evolving as a species, says Krehel.  ""Hacking these days is about monetization of data -- making a profit in the underground cyberworld. Perhaps that is why we no longer see site defacement being popular as the focus has shifted to consumer data, with the most favorite choice being financial data.""  In March email marketing firm Epsilon Interactive was hacked and details for Citigroup account holders were stolen, amongst others. It's not clear if that hack was a jumping-off point for May's attack.  Although names, account numbers and emails will not give cybercriminals access to account data, it does make possible effective phishing attacks. Criminals could include a customer's card number in the email, for example, which could be enough to convince them to follow a link to a bogus Website setup to capture yet more details.  With perfect bad timing just days before the hack took place, Citigroup's head of global enterprise payments (and former head of its credit card unit) -- Paul Galant -- told Reuters in April that ""security breaches happen ... the mission of the banking industry is to keep the customer base safe and customers feeling secure about their financial transactions and payments"". He added that Citigroup spends ""a tremendous amount of money on security. We take it very, very seriously -- I don't know that there's a way we could take it more seriously.""","Payment","Other","Finance","US","TRUE","NULL"

The finding, released in two reports on Monday by Interhack Corp., arrives three months after the incident occurred.  In its report, Columbus, Ohio-based Interhack said the missing backup tape featured newly discovered names and Social Security numbers of 47,245 individuals; the names and Social Security numbers of 19,388 former state employees; and banking information on less than 100 businesses, according to Ron Sylvester, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Administrative Services.  Additionally, the names and federal employee identification numbers of 40,088 businesses were unearthed by Interhack. Information from that file was being used by the state's Ohio Administrative Knowledge System (OAKS) to help populate and test E-Controlling Board, a state Controlling Board business application.  Following Interhack's analysis, Sylvester confirmed that in total more than 1.3 million pieces of personal data were stored on the stolen backup tape. The groups affected include state taxpayers, Medicaid providers, payroll vendors, dependents, students and state government employees.  The incident is expected to cost the state almost $3 million. Of that total, $2.3 million covers projected and existing enrollment in Debix Inc. credit protection services. Debix enrollment paid for by the state for affected individuals will remain open until Oct. 31. Debix protection will not be extended toward any businesses with information on the lost backup tape.  At the time of its theft, the missing tape was being used to carry information from the government's office tower to an off-site location, where roughly 100 state workers and 100 Accenture employees are responsible for testing, configuring code and customizing PeopleSoft applications. That effort is part of Ohio's massive $158 million OAKS ERP project.  ""The particular drive that this tape was used to back up... was the sort of the testbed drive, so a lot of data was real and historical data being used to test different parts of the OAKS system -- everything from payroll functionality to accounting functionality,"" said Sylvester. ""That's why there were a lot of these files on here, because they were testing things like cutting purchase orders, paying mileage checks -- all the business processes that the current legacy systems use -- and making sure the way OAKS was being configured would work.""  Since it was a temporary site, a network administrator from the state's previous administration had decided as part of his business continuity plan that he would take backup tapes home every night. However, Sylvester said over time that practice had ""devolved"" to include interns taking the tapes home.","Bank,Personal","TheftLoss","Public","US","TRUE","NULL"

The Office of Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data yesterday revealed that the Hong Kong Prevention Association (HKPA) made cold calls to people, offering them a chance to join a free medical check-up scheme and asking them for personal data. The callers claimed the checks were endorsed by the government, which was not true.  They also failed to explain clearly that the data would be transferred to Aegon Direct Marketing Services Insurance Broker, for use in direct marketing activities.  Aegon Direct paid for the information, which used it for promoting insurance products.  Privacy Commissioner Allan Chiang Yam-wang said the data was collected in a misleading and arguably deceitful way. He said the insurer was also accountable as it had approved scripts used by the association's telemarketers.  ""Such irresponsible and recalcitrant behaviour must be condemned,"" he said.  Chiang said the commission had received 11 inquiries and five complaints about the matter. It investigated three complaints. It found that the association had signed an agreement with Aegon Direct to sell data from at least 2,000 people every month.  Over the past two years Aegon Direct paid more than HK$10 million for the data obtained from 363,830 people and for any medical check-ups they had. In the end, about 168,000 people undertook simple kidney checks.  Chiang said callers had slurred through almost 400 words in one minute when it came to explaining how the data would be passed to Aegon Direct.  ""Once they mentioned the role of Aegon Direct, they would speak very fast. They only emphasised the free body check throughout the call,"" he said. The commissioner ordered the insurer to destroy all the data obtained from the HKPA, except information about those who had bought insurance, by the end of September. Failure to do so would be a criminal offence.  Aegon Direct said it had never authorised the association to say its promotional campaign had been endorsed by the government. The HKPA did not respond to Post inquiries.  Meanwhile, the commission also found that the way the MTR Corporation handled its CCTV footage was not good enough. It stored some footage longer than required and failed to use an encrypted device to transfer it.  The MTR, which has 3,342 CCTVs installed at stations and 429 on trains, said it would study the recommendations.","Personal","Misuse","Healthcare","HK","TRUE","NULL"

The compromised list contained names, login names, e-mail addresses and 17-character Vehicle Identification Number--an automotive industry standard--which was used to send welcome e-mail messages to customers that had registered for an Owner Link account.  Another 2.7 million My Acura account users were also affected by the breach, but Honda said the list contained only e-mail addresses. Acura is the company's luxury vehicle brand.  According to Honda's notification e-mail to affected customers, the list was managed by a vendor. All Things Digital suggested, but could not confirm, that the vendor in question is e-mail marketing firm Silverpop Systems, which has been linked with the recent hacking incidents including that of fast-food giant McDonald's.  In a Web page addressing affected customers, Honda said it would be ""difficult"" for a victim's identity to be stolen based on the information that had been leaked. However, it has warned that customers ought to be wary of unsolicited e-mail messages requesting for personal information such as social security or credit card numbers.  Compelling scams an 'obvious danger' Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, pointed out that cybercriminals who possess the list may e-mail the car owners to trick them into clicking on malicious attachments or links, or fool them into handing over personal information.  ""If the hackers were able to present themselves as Honda, and reassured you that they were genuine by quoting your Vehicle Identification Number, then as a Honda customer you might very likely click on a link or open an attachment,"" he explained in a blog post.  Acura customers, he added, could also be on the receiving end of spam campaigns.  Cluley noted that the incident serves as a reminder that companies not only need to have adequate measures in place to protect customer data in their hands, they also need their partners and third-party vendors to ""follow equally stringent best practices"".

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said in a statement Nexon reported to the commission late Friday afternoon that the company on Thursday discovered the leakage of personal data of its online game Maple Storys 13.2 million subscribers.  The information was leaked weeks before the unlisted companys planned initial public offering of its Japanese affiliate on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 14. Nexon aims to raise more than 95 billion yen ($1.2 billion) through the IPO, which would be the largest on the Tokyo bourse this year.  KCC said it, jointly with police and computer security experts, is investigating the hacking case. The leaked data included user IDs, names, resident registration numbers and passwords, it added.  A Nexon official said the leaked data covered no information on financial transactions and bank account numbers. And it did not affect overseas subscribers of the online game.  The company has asked game subscribers to change passwords to prevent additional damage, although the leaked resident registration numbers and passwords were encrypted. The entire subscription membership of Maple Story is about 18 million, the company official said.  Nexon, which has gained a global reputation through Maple Story and online game Kart Rider, is one of the two leading online game developers in South Korea, along with NCsoft Corp.

Police have not yet confirmed any damage caused by the leak, but this is considered the countrys largest leak of its kind given the number of people involved.  In February, the personal data of 10.8 million customers were leaked when the online shopping mall Auction.co.kr was hacked.  The Cyber Terror Response Center of the National Police Agency dispatched two detectives to GS Caltex headquarters in southern Seoul to investigate.  The discs -- one DVD and a CD-Rom which are believed to have been thrown away -- were found early this month by an office worker in a backstreets trash pile near Gangnam subway station in Seoul.  The DVD contained 76 files in a folder named GS Caltex, including the names, social security numbers, addresses, cell phone numbers, email addresses and workplaces of customers sorted by age. The CD-Rom is believed to be a sample of the DVD as it contains only a few peoples personal data.  We received the CD around 3 p.m. Thursday and have been comparing the personal information with the one stored in our own server, a GS Caltex source told reporters.  We have tentatively concluded that it is membership information collected for the bonus card issued by our company. The bonus card offers discounts for fill-ups, and is mainly issued by gas stations to compile customers personal information.  The bonus card in question contains no credit card or bank account details, as it is a simple card that cannot make purchases, says senior GS Caltex executive Na Wan-bae. There has been no trace of hacking. And no one has made threatening phone calls using the list.  Experts say a GS Caltex employee likely stole the information for personal purposes given no signs of hacking and the anti-hacking system being intact.  For now, we are investigating the case while taking all possibilities into account, including hacking and leaks by its own employee, a police official said. We can charge both the person who leaked the information and the company for violating the law on telecom networks and information protection.","Personal","Error","Manufacturing","KR","TRUE","NULL"

According to American Banker, Citigroup has blamed “limitations” in the piece of software responsible for redacting the documents.  “As a result of this limitation in technology, personally identifiable information could be exposed and read if electronic versions of the court records were accessed and downloaded from the courts' online docket system and if the person downloading the information had the technical knowledge and software to restore the redacted information,” the company stated.  When the incident was discovered in April 2011, Citi took immediate steps to remediate the issue. However, the US Justice Department’s US Trustee Program was unhappy with the fact that Citi failed to disclose the full extent of the breach.  In addition, the bank also failed to come up with a solution to the problem, and it did not promise to notify customers.

John Strain.  The investigation also uncovered from his home computer about 1.8 million Social Security numbers from the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, where Kim had been employed as an auditor. Veterans Affairs' officials have said only 185,000 numbers are at risk because many were repeated in the file.  Tae Kim, 28, was booked at Orange County Jail and is being held in lieu of $1 million bail after being arrested at 5 p.m. Thursday at a car wash in Koreatown, police said.  On April 7, two Asian men identified as Kim and Justin Hong, purchased jewelry from Jewelry Exchange at 15732 Tustin Village Way using three skimmed cards belong to three different victims, one of whom was actor Marlon Wayans, Strain said.  Wayans is best known for his role in the now defunct WB series The Wayans Bros. and the Scary Movie film series.  Kim was on formal probation and a search was conducted at his Los Angeles residence June 14 where a computer was taken as evidence. After a search warrant was obtained, police found the Social Security numbers hidden in a computer file.  Kim had worked at the Veteran Affairs office since 2003 when he was a student at USC but quit in February of this year when he discovered a background check would be conducted.  The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs verified that Kim did not have permission to possess the Social Security numbers. Officials have notified several victims from Orange County, police said.  In May 2006, Social Security numbers for 26.5 million U.S. veterans were stolen in an apparent random burglary in Maryland from a Veterans Affairs employee's house after he took the laptop containing the information home without authorization.  Authorities from the Orange County District Attorney's Office, LAPD and U.S. Marshalls have been attempting to arrest Kim since August.  Kim is believed to be a member of Koreatown Gangsters, police said. He faces eight different charges, including commercial burglary, fraudulent use of an access card, identity theft, criminal street gang activity and computer access fraud.  Justin Hong is in L.A.

The data breach affected patients, staff, vendors and contractors at the Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, and their two affiliated health centers. The personal information was collected over the past 20 years and included names, addresses, social security numbers, patients medical histories, and the occupational/employee health information of staff, vendors, contractors, and others.  HHC stressed that the files are not readily accessible without highly specialized expertise and data-mining tools, and there is no evidence to indicate that the information has been accessed and misused. At the same time, HHC admitted that it did not know where the files are.  The loss of this data occurred through the negligence of a contracted firm that specializes in the secure transport and storage of sensitive data, but HHC is taking responsibility for providing information and credit monitoring services to any affected individual who may be worried about the possibility of identity theft, said HHC President Alan D. Aviles.  The 14-hospital system said it was providing free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year to the nearly 1.7 million people affected.

To recoup the cost, HHC said it was suing GRM Management Information Services to recover all of the costs associated with notifying all affected individuals, and to pay for other damages related to the loss of the data.  HHC said it reported the data breach to state and federal oversight, regulatory, and consumer protection agencies.

While no charges have yet been filed against him, Helkowskis employment with Canton Group has ended. And yesterday, he took to reddit to tell everyone about it in a post entitled IamA Hacker who was Raided by the FBI and Secret Service AMAA! To prove his identity, he even posted a redacted copy of the search warrant he was served.  How did the FBI track him down so fast? It turns out that Helkowski told just about everyone (including co-workers) about what he was doing. And since the vulnerability he used was the same one Canton Group had reported to UMD on February 27, it didnt take a lot of sleuthing to follow a trail that pointed straight back to Helkowskis home in the Baltimore suburb of Parkville.  On the night of March 16, Helkowski and his wife arrived home to find the raid in progress.  There were 12 or so people. I wasn't home when they busted in my door. They actually busted in the side door. My dog was home. He ran out the doggie door then ran out the gate that they had opened. They let my dog run away basically.  I was driving up to my house, returning from dinner, and all the lights in my house were on, many cars parked out front, and cars in my driveway. I saw people walking around out front. I wondered why there was a party at my house.  As I slowed down to take a look, they yelled at me, pointed a gun (I saw one at least), and ordered me to stop the car and put my hands out the window. I did so. They then told me to use one hand to shut off the car and hold the key out the window as well. I did that. They took the key, and then demanded I get out of the car.  They then [put my hands] against the car and frisked me. They immediately took my cellphone from me, and then led me inside. Helkowski asked permission to call for his father to retrieve his dog while agents detained him and his wife. An agent called Helkowskis father, saying he was a friend and had noticed the dog was loose, Helkowski said. His father came to the scene to retrieve the dogand was then detained by federal agents. My dad of course had to accuse me in front of the FBI Are you gonna learn your lesson now and not do stuff like this? or something like that... in front of the FBI. Geez dad. Thanks.  Helkowski said that he cooperated fully with the agents. During the RAID I provided my 20+ character system encryption password, my Keepass password, the location of my keyfiles, and a full description of everything. I basically 'confessed' everything to the FBI already. My stance is that I did nothing 'morally wrong.' My attempt the entire time has been to help the university improve their security.  In a March 20 staff memo published by the University of Maryland from Ann G. Wiley, UMDs interim vice president and chief information officer, Wiley wrote, The FBI has informed the University that the intrusion resulted in no public release of any information and no damage to the institution, except for the release of personal data of one senior University official, who has been notified. We are unable to comment further on the intrusion at this time.""","Personal","Misuse","Educational","US","TRUE","NULL"
