  "summary": "Federal authorities charged eight people with identity theft for filing fraudulent federal tax refunds in five separate cases, including that of a former Boca Raton Regional Hospital scheduler.  Shalamar Major had access to the personal information of the hospital\u2019s patients and gave it to Tanisha Wright in exchange for the promise of future payments, according to a federal indictment against both of them. Wright allegedly used that information to file 57 fraudulent tax returns seeking $306,720 in refunds. She received the money on debit cards and split the proceeds with Major, according to the charges.",
