The error resulted from an incorrect fax number entered onto the fax cover sheet (the intended number ended in 0842, while the unintended number ended in 0843). The unintended recipient notified the sender of the information that the fax was incorrectly delivered and the unintended recipient acknowledged that the fax was shredded. The fax was then correctly delivered and receipt was confirmed.",
