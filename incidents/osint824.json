  "summary": "A laptop containing information about the Mortonhall ashes scandal has been stolen.  The offices of charity Sands Lothian were broken into over the weekend. Among the items taken was the computer holding details of the charity's communication with the City of Edinburgh Council about the case.  It was Sands who uncovered the practice at Mortonhall.  It was revealed parents of new and stillborn babies who were cremated at the Edinburgh facility were told there were no ashes to collect. In reality, the remains were buried in the garden of remembrance.  Manager Dorothy Maitland said the thieves took the laptop and a box of keys from the office at Craiglockhart Leisure Centre. She is not sure if the computer is encrypted or not.",
