  "summary": "Canada's Montfort Hospital recently announced that that an unencrypted USB drive containing more than 25,000 patients' health information was recently lost. The drive contained patients' names, summary data on the type of service provided, the date of service, and the health service provider code.  \"Philippe Marleau, Montfort\u2019s vice-president of quality and organization performance, said Friday that the employee lost the USB key somewhere between the hospital and home and initially tried to find the key herself,\" writes The Ottawa Citizen's Chris Cobb. \"When she couldn\u2019t find it, she called her supervisors to report it missing. ... The employee has now been 're-sensitized' to security issues and is back at work, he added, but she wasn\u2019t suspended or otherwise penalized.\"",
