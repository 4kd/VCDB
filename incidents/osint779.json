  "summary": "The Regina Qu'Appelle Regional Health Authority (RQRHA) failed to follow provisions of the Health Information Protection Act (HIPA) in a 2010 privacy breach, according to Saskatchewan's Information and Privacy Commissioner.  Gary Dickson's office began an investigation into the Regina breach after 15 addressograph cards - blue cards attached to patients' charts when they go to a hospital for tests or admissions - were found on the ground near two facilities belonging to a document destruction company on May 20, 2010.  The cards contained personal information of patients who had been treated at the Pasqua and Regina General hospitals.  The privacy breach occurred when an employee of a document destruction company was transferring the cards in a container with a lid between two facilities. The container's lid was not secured and the cards flew out. They were discovered two days later by a member of the public. ",
