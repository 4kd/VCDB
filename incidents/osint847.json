In the first breach, the device contained data relating to around 600 maternity patients, according to an undertaking signed by the trust with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). A data controller employee downloaded the data on to a personal memory stick in order to do some work at home.  \"Due to not having received up to date information governance training, the employee was unaware that an encrypted device issued by the data controller should have been used,\" says the undertaking.
