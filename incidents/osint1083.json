  "summary": "Last week, New Hampshire-based St. Mary\u2019s Bank, a credit union regulated by the New Hampshire Banking Department, started alerting customers after a piece of malware was discovered on several of the organization\u2019s computers.  A total of 115,775 New Hampshire residents are being notified.  The malware infection was spotted on the computer of one St. Mary\u2019s employee on May 26. After a computer security consulting firm analyzed the breach, it was determined that 23 workstations had been compromised.  The malware, designed to capture screenshots, was on the computers since February 2013.  So far, there\u2019s no evidence that sensitive information such as social security numbers, account information, and transaction records have been stolen.  Impacted customers are offered one year of complementary credit monitoring and ID theft protection services via Experian.",
