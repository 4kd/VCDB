  "summary": "The personal information of more than 2,100 Boston Children's Hospital patients has been jeopardized after a hospital employee lost a laptop containing unencrypted health data while at a conference in Buenos Aires, the Boston Globe reported. The data included names, birth dates, diagnoses and treatment information but no financial data or Social Security numbers.  Although the laptop was password protected, it was not encrypted, the hospital said Tuesday in a statement. During the time of theft, the laptop held a file with the patient data, included as an email attachment but not saved on the desktop. Boston Children's staff could not determine if the file was accessed.",
