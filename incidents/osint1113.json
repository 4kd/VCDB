  "summary": "A Georgetown home builder accused of using a five year old's identity to get more than a million dollars in loans from a bank has been convicted.  A federal jury convicted Lee Tevis of bank fraud, false loan application, and identity theft, among other charges.  Investigators say Tevis set up bogus corporations to bypass loan limits at American Founders Bank.  They say he also used the social security number of a foreman's five year old son to pass the bank's credit check.  Tevis faces 30 years in prison when he's sentenced in December.",
