  "summary": "South Korea\u2019s largest online shopping site earlier this month was attacked by a Chinese hacker who made off with the user information on 18 million members and a large amount of financial data.    The attack was launched from China's internet. After the incident, Auction.co.kr received a phone call offering to exchange the user information for money, the reports said.  According to a report on Dark Visitor, a security blog site, the Chinese hacker did not directly attack the server. The hacker sent out bulk emailings to the auction staff containing \u201chacker procedures\" that may have contained malware. When the staff members confirmed the emails, the hacker was able to gain their IDs. The hacker was then able to log into the Auction server using the staffer\u2019s ID.  The WASC report categorizes the exploit as a cross-site request forgery attack. \"The attack description is vague, but can be best described as session hijacking,\" the organization said. ",
