  "summary": "As it turns out, even highway safety regulators are vulnerable to the ravaging hand of cybercriminals. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had some of its servers hacked last week, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.  The 10 servers involved are used for reports from automakers about their plans for recalls, as well as for progress reports on continuing and past investigations. Normally, the information stored on the affected servers is public and can be located along with other information on recalls or defect investigations. But on Friday, the usually public documents became inaccessible.  The blockage was caused by an alert about a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, an agency spokesman wrote in an e-mailed statement. The statement said that the episode \u201cwas limited in scope, involved systems which host publicly available information\u201d and that no personal or confidential business information had been compromised.  The 10 servers that were attacked are no longer connected to the Internet, the agency said, and \u201ccountermeasures to return all equipment to normal operation\u201d were under way. It wasn\u2019t clear when the documents would be available again, and an agency spokesman declined to answer questions regarding the source of the attack.",
