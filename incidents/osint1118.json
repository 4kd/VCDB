  "summary": "Anonymous hackers have leaked what they claim to be email addresses and passwords of members of the US Congress and their staff.  There are around 1,800 records comprising mail.house.gov and senate.gov email addresses and clear text passphrases.  \u201cFor the purposes of being far too generous with you guys, we have removed some of the passwords and shuffled the order of the remaining ones,\u201d the hackers wrote next to the data.  \u201cThese are all current, valid credentials but they are not in the original pairings. We reserve the right to spontaneously decide this restraint was unjustified,\u201d they added.  The leaked email addresses are publicly available on several websites. However, the passwords don\u2019t appear to be taken from older leaks.  On the other hand, it\u2019s difficult to verify if the data was actually stolen from the systems of the US House of Representatives or the Senate.  A few hours ago, Anonymous hackers also published contact details of US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contractors, subcontractors and employees. FEMA has yet to confirm the attack.",
