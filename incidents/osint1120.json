  "summary": "Stanford University is working with security consultants and law enforcement following a recent breach in its computer network, according to a local ABC News report.  The marks the second time Stanford University has been breached in less than three months. In May, a hacker known as \u201cAgent 47\u201d penetrated the campus information technology infrastructure and stole names, email address, photos and other data for more than 1,400 users and then posted the compromised data online for others to see.  In a press release, Stanford stated that it wasn\u2019t aware of any protected health information, personal financial information or Social Security numbers being compromised. The attack was similar to an attack on a range of companies and large organizations in the U.S. and is working with security consultants and law enforcement to determine its source and impact.  The university is asking everyone with a Stanford University Network ID to change their passwords as a precautionary measure, and it warned that the process may have to be repeated as it learns more about the breach.",
