  "summary": "Thousands of people are now vulnerable to identity theft, and it's all because of a stolen laptop.  The information, which includes Social Security and drivers license numbers, was on a King County sheriff's office computer that was stolen from a detective.  The laptop and a personal hard drive were full of case files, including personal information about thousands of crime victims, suspects, witnesses and even police officers.  The laptop was stolen last March from the backseat of a detective's undercover pickup truck. ",
