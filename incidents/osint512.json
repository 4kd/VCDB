  "summary": "India\u2019s government and military have suffered one of the worst cyber attacks in the nation\u2019s history, after over 10,000 email accounts belonging to top officials were compromised, despite a warning from the country\u2019s cyber security agency.  The attack came on 12 July, four days after the government was warned by the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), part of the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), that some sophisticated malware was spotted targeting specific individuals and organisations.  Email addresses belonging to officials working at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, defence, home, finance and external affairs ministries and intelligence agencies were nabbed in the attack, which has been blamed on state actors.",
