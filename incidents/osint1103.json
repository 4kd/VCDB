  "summary": "18-year-old Marshall Williams, a student of the Denton High School in Denton, Texas, has been arrested and charged with hacking into the school\u2019s systems on two separate occasions.   According to Fox 4, Williams hacked into the high school\u2019s secure Wi-Fi network \u2013 which stores test results, employee records, a master key list and building alarm codes \u2013 in March and April. In addition, he used school printers to print out the stolen security codes and test results.  Investigators traced the breach back to the student\u2019s phone based on logs and an IP address. Surveillance videos showed that he was in the Wi-Fi area during the breaches.  Arrest documents reveal that Williams wanted to get back at the school after an English teacher refused to grade a report he wrote based on a trip to a gun show.  The teacher argued that the report came shortly after the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre. However, he later apologized.",
