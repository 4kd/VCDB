The medical center is not disclosing the number of patients affected. \"In this case, due to insufficient contact information for those who may be affected, individual notifications are not possible,\" according to a website notice.  Officials learned of the breach on Jan. 22, the notice says. The laptop contained health and personal information about an undisclosed number of adult patients seen between 2008 and January 2013.
