  "summary": "  A former probation officer who handed details of a domestic abuse victim to her alleged abuser has been fined just \u00a3150.  Victoria Idowu, who has since lost her job, was handed the fine after pleading guilty to breaching the Data Protection Act by handing over the confidential information.  Camberwell Green Magistrates\u2019 Court heard that the 39-year-old was working for London Probation Trust when she handed over the details in January last year. Prosecution told the court that Idowu, from Stockwell, London, had contacted the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference  regarding the alleged abuser, concerned about mistaken identity.  She was sent an email on 5 January containing the victim\u2019s full details, including her address, and that same morning sent a text message containing the information.  The next day the police officer was contacted by the alleged abuse victim in a \u201cdistressed state\u201d, Miss Khan said, saying she had been made aware that her ex-partner had obtained her address.  Idowu, who the court heard had no previous convictions, was subsequently dismissed for gross misconduct.",
