As you probably know, we are in the business of selling uniforms, apparel and related items. Many of these sales take place through \u201cweb stores\u201d that are developed and hosted by a third party vendor on behalf of Mission Linen Supply. Although purchases made through these web stores are considered transactions with Mission Linen Supply, personally identifiable information that was provided by persons who purchased goods through the web stores was stored and maintained by this third party vendor and not by Mission Linen Supply.",
