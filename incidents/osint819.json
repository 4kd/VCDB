  "summary": "The mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, warned on Thursday that it may have lost internal data as a result of computer hacking and the theft of a laptop.  The problems add to a complicated picture for ENRC, a London-based but Kazakh-facing producer of minerals from iron ore to coal, which received an indicative takeover offer last week but is also the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.  ENRC said it had notified the information commissioner about the data loss saying: \"The first incident relates to the theft of a laptop during a domestic burglary, while the second incident relates to an intrusion into the group's electronic systems by a third party.\"",
