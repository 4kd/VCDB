  "summary": " Arkansas State University says more than 200 university employees have been affected by tax fraud this year \u2014 but the school hasn't yet identified how the employees' personal information was obtained.  Arkansas State first said in February that fraudulent tax returns had been filed on behalf of 27 university employees. At a meeting of the Faculty Senate last week, ASU human resources employees said that number has grown to 215.  The Jonesboro Sun reports (http://is.gd/FHslOB ) that the fraud victims include faculty and staff at ASU's Jonesboro campus and at least one retiree.  Arkansas State says it will pay for a credit monitoring system for each identity theft victim for at least a year.  The university and law enforcement authorities continue to investigate the source of the data breach.",
